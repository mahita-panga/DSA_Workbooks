"""
Factory Pattern  -> Creational pattern which provides an interface for creating
objects in superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects created.

Example: Think of a factory which is producing different varieties of product and
this can expand in future to a scale where we might need to add more products to our application
So, instead of tightly coupling to one particular product type, we create a interface which has the
methods to produce items. How these items are produced will be implemented in the subclasses.

-> Used in Payment Instances where different payment gateway instances need to be created
