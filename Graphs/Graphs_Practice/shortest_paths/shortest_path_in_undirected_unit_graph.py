https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/shortest-path-in-undirected-graph-having-unit-distance/1

Given an undirected graph with unit edges, find the shortest path from  src to all nodes and if no connection between src to
the node, then return -1 in that place.

NOTE : - DFS gave TLE.
       - TOPOSORT should NOT be applied here as it is undirected graph

INTUITION:
    -> Graph Creation:
        With given edges, create an adjancency list. Since it is undirected, add edge to both src and dest adj lists.
    -> Variable initialization:
        -> distance[] -> all initialized to âˆž
        P.S: Visited[] is not needed since we need not track the visited status of the graph.
        -> q for bfs traversal
    -> Action:
        -> distance[src] = 0
        -> add src to queue
        -> while queue:
            curr_node = queue.pop()
            if distance[curr] + 1 < distance[neighbour]:
                update distance[neighbour] to distance[curr] + 1 // +1 since it is unit distance
                queue.append(neighbour)
        -> This will ensure shortest path from src to all connected components.
        -> For unconnected components, set dist to -1.
