153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

    â€¢	In a rotated sorted array, the minimum element is the only element where the previous element is greater than it.
	â€¢	If nums[mid] > nums[ub], that means rotation has happened after mid, so search in right half.
	â€¢	Else, the minimum is either at mid or in the left half.
