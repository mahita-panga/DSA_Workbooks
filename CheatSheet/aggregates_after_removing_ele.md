# Aggregates After Removing Elements

## Aggregates After Removing One Element

When creating aggregates (like sums, products, or other operations) after removing one element, we can utilize **prefix sums** logic. Hereâ€™s how to approach it:

1. **Precompute Prefix and Suffix Arrays**:
   - Create prefix and suffix arrays that hold the aggregate values.
   - Carefully handle nullifying conditions for multiplications or divisions, especially when zeros are involved:
     - **More than one zero**: All products excluding any element will be zero.
     - **Exactly one zero**: Only the product excluding that zero will be non-zero.

2. **Result Calculation**:
   - For each index `i`, the result of removing the element at that index can be computed as:
     ```
     result[i] = prefix[i] * suffix[i + 1]
     ```

## Aggregates After Removing Multiple Elements

### Fixed Element Removal with Known Indices

If the number of elements to remove is small and the indices are known, we can:

- Use the prefix-suffix arrays as described above.
- Instead of computing values for just one index, compute for each combination of indices removed.

### Removing Contiguous Elements

If we are removing a fixed number of contiguous elements, we can use a **sliding window** approach:

- This method is effective for recalculating sums, products, or other operations as the window slides across the array.

### Removing Multiple Elements Without Specific Indexes

If the specific indices or the number of elements to remove is not known in advance, consider the following techniques:

1. **Segment Tree**:
   - If frequent element removals are involved, segment trees allow for efficient range queries and updates.
   - This can handle any subset of elements by marking them as removed and updating the segment sum accordingly.

2. **Set-based Exclusion with Prefix Sums**:
   - For dynamic indices of elements to remove, maintain a set of indices for removed elements.
   - Adjust the prefix sums or other aggregates accordingly.

## Time Complexity

- **Simple Exclusions**: O(1) for each query.
- **Sliding Windows**: O(n) for the entire array.
- **Segment Tree Updates**: O(log n) per update or query.

## Space Complexity

- **Segment Tree or Prefix-Suffix Arrays**: O(n).
