    "Top-down approach where we solve the problem recursively and store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. It's like having a cheat sheet where you write down the answers to problems you've already solved so you don't have to solve them again.\n",

    "In the below example, the @cache decorator automatically handles the caching of subproblem results. If you call fib(10), the function will recursively compute fib(9) and fib(8), but it will store these results so that subsequent calls to fib(9) and fib(8) are retrieved from the cache instead of being recomputed.\n"
