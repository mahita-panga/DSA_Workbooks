"""
Given two inputs,
First input is
the location map,
a 2D array in which each cell contains 0/ E/ X
0 = Robot, E = Empty, X = blocker
Second input is the query. It's a 1D array consisting of distance to the closest blocker in the order fro bottom and right
[2,2,4,1]
â†’ This means distance of 2 to the left blocker, 2 to the top blocker, 4 to the bottom block
the right blocker
Write a function that takes these two inputs and returns the index of the robots (if any) that matches th
we're looking for.
Input:

OEEEX
EOXXX
EEEEE
XEOEE
XEXEX
