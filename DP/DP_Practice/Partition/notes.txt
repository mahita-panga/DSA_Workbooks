-> When a problem arises where we have to find the best ways to partition and solve a problem, then it is
partition DP

Ex: Best way to multiply matrix with minimal cost: ABCD -> A(BC)D or (AB)CD or A(BCD)
            i  j
            ABCD
       /     |   \
   (ABC)D   A(BCD) ...
   i  j ij  iji  j
-> Here we are trying to find the best 2 partitions which gives us minimal cost
