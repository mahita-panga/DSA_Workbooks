LC 64: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/

Intuition:
    Greedy will not work because we might miss on the actual path with min sum
    Recursion : Top Down approach, find min of all sum
    Tabulation: Bottom Up Approach:
        First Rule: Initialize dp array of same size
        Second Rule: Define base case i.e. dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
        Third Rule: Update dp table action:
            If i > 0, then up = dp[i-1][j], otherwise up is set to infinity (float('inf'))
            to ensure it wonâ€™t be considered in the min function.
            If j > 0, then left = dp[i][j-1], otherwise left is set to infinity for the same reason.

            The value of dp[i][j] is updated to the sum of the
            current grid value grid[i][j] and the minimum of up and left.
