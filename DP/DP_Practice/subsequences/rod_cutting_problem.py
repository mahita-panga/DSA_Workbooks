"""

Intuition:
    This is similar to unbounded knapsack.
    Similarity:
        price of each piece is like weights
        n(no. of pieces) is N (W)
        We need to create a cuts[] which indicates the length of pieces /val

        A rod of length N can be divided into any numb of pieces such that total is ==N.

#1D Space Optimized: Since we are needing only the value from previous row of same column,
# we can maintain the values in same array
# Ex: Lets say We have to calculate the cur[3] element, we need only a single variable (preValue). The catch is that we can initially place this preValue at the position cur[3] (before finding its updated value) and later while calculating for the current rowâ€™s cell cur[3], the value present there automatically serves as the preValue and we can use it to find the required cur[3] value. ( If there is any confusion please see the code).
# After calculating the cur[3] value we store it at the cur[3] position so this cur[3] will automatically serve as preValue for the next row. In this way, we space-optimize the tabulation approach by just using one row.
