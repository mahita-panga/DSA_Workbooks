"""
0/1_Knapsack
You are given weights and values of N items, and put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. Note that we have only one quantity of each item.

Intuition:
    Recursion: Every val in the array has pick/not_pick. if picking, update the weight.

-> Express everything in terms of index,weight(W).
-> Explore all the possibilities
-> Return max of all possibilites.
