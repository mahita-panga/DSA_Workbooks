-> Memoization : Top Down Approach -> Start with the top value and identify the subproblems as we go down.
If a subproblem is already solved then remember it

-> Tabulation : Bottom Up Approach -> Identify the base cases and then use these to solve until we reach
the point for we which we are finding the solution.
    * FIRST RULE OF TABULATION: Declare same size array as the input.
    * Assign base case's into the declared array
    * Convert the recursive function call to array variables

-> The pick/no-pick (or include/exclude) method is a common approach used in recursion to
solve problems involving subsequences, subsets, or combinations.

** CONVERT list to tuples before passing to @cache **
-> When using @cache annotation, make sure you dont pass lists into the function as list is mutable
i.e it cause Unhashable error since @cache tries to create a dictionary keys out of the argument passed
