19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

Bruteforce approach:
   -> Traverse the list to find its length,
    and then traverse again to reach the node that is length - n from the start. Remove that node. This approach requires two passes through the linked list.
	â€¢	Space Complexity: O(1), but requires two passes.
Optimized Way:
    fast and slow pointer approach:
        Use two pointers, fast and slow,
        where fast moves n steps ahead of slow.
        When fast reaches the end, slow will be at the node before the one to remove.
	-> This ensures a single traversal.
