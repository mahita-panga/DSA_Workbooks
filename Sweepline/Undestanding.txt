Concepts in this algorithm:
-> Prefix array concept
-> Ordered Dict
-> Binary Search


Algorithm:
-> Event Definition:
 The first step is to define “events” => Events are points where something significant happens, such as the beginning snd end of a line segment.
 In sweepline, we process the events left to right or top to bottom in SORTED order
 
-> Event Queue:
 Place all events in a sorted data structure like ordered dict/list. Sorting by the x-coordinate (or y for vertical sweeps) allows us to process events in order.

-> Active Structure
 This keeps track of the objects (e.g., line segments, intervals) currently intersected by the sweep line.As we move the sweepline
 we add elements or remove elements which is implemented by set or list

-> Event Processing:
 For each event, update the active structure based on whether it’s an “add” event (e.g., start of an interval) or a “remove” event (e.g., end of an interval).
