-> Stacks can be used // similar to asteroid collision
--
traverse right - left
maintain stack for potential cars which can cause crash
if the cari speed > stack top => definite car crash.
calculate the collision time,
add it to res,
push the new fleet along with ind and time into stack if ind < len(cars). if collision is beyond the purview, we dont need to consider that
